Currently having troubles with malloc that came from whatever arm-none-eabi-gcc linked (pcbuffer calls it).

Downloaded and built newlib with recommendations from this guide:
https://balau82.wordpress.com/2010/12/16/using-newlib-in-arm-bare-metal-programs/
Got newlib here: https://sourceware.org/newlib/

I built it and put everything that came in the arm-none-eabi folder into the assets folder here.

Next steps would be to add a check for a malloc that returns null and then play with compiler settings until it works, potentially linking the recently built newlib.

This guy seemed to have figured it out: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10467244/using-newlibs-malloc-in-an-arm-cortex-m3
