# gcc-builds

For microcontroller projects built with the GNU toolchain.

This project is approaching stability. The following action items remain before it can be considered stable:

  * Boilerplated Makefile to support Windows/Unix/OSX usage
  * Multi-target file structure with make `XXXXX\_config` (or other) target configuration options
  * Compiler arguments sorted out and linker scripts minified (if possible)
  * Thorough, multi-platform development instructions

The following features would be nice to have:

  * J-Link utility scripts directory
  * Build timestamp with commit/tag String + Project name banner
  * Git commit conventions established
  * Commenting & code style conventions established
  * Separate documentation repository established
